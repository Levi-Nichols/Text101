    in the air.  Covering almost surface is stacks and cluttered dirty dishes and
    utensils.  An old, large fridge is situated along one wall, and there is a staircase
    heading down toward the back of the room.  You..\r\n\r\n1) Walk to the fridge
    and open the door.\r\n\r\n2) Walk across the room, being careful not to knock
    over any of the rubbish littering the counters, and head down the stairs."
