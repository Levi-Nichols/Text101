  storyText: 'You run out of the kitchen, hearing a roar from somewhere behind.  Your
    suddenly freezing, your heavy breath coming out in a fog.  You cross the threshold
    of the house and run to your friends car on the street, jump in and in between
    gulps of air tell them to get out of there.  Your friends speed off, not questioning
    the fear on your eyes or the roar they heard moments before.  You can''t shake
    the feeling that something is still following you, thought the rear-view mirror
    shows nothing but road stretching behind you.  You let out a sigh, but notice
    it comes out in fog.  Well, it is pretty chilly out.

    Search for a different outcome?


    1) Yes, I can do better.


    2) No, I''ll quit while I''m ahead.
