  storyText: 'You run out of the kitchen, hearing a scream from somewhere behind.  Your
    suddenly cold, your heavy breath coming out in puffs of smoke.  You cross the
    threshold of the house and run to your car on the street, jump in and in between
    gulps of air tell them to drive off.  Your friend speeds off, not questioning
    the fear in your eyes or the scream they heard moments before.  You can''t shake
    the feeling that something is still following you, even though the rear-view mirror
    shows nothing but road stretching behind you.  You let out a sigh, but notice
    it still comes out in fog.  Well, it is pretty chilly out.


    You Survived... But at what cost?


    Search for a different outcome?


    1) Yes, I can do better.


    2) No, I''ll quit while I''m ahead.
