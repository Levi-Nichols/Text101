  storyText: 'You return back to your car to jeers from your friends.  You shake off
    there comments and try to hide your embarrassment as you get in the car.  The
    car leaves, the old house receding in the rear view mirror.  You let out a sigh
    of relief.  Something in the mirror catches your eye, and you see that one of
    the upstairs windows of the house has a light shining from it.


    You Survived... But at what cost?


    Search for a different outcome?


    1) Yes, I can do better.


    2) No, I''ll quit while I''m ahead.'
