  storyText: 'You return back to your car to jeers from your friends.  You shake off
    there comments and try to hide your embarrassment.  You drive off, the old house
    receding in your rear-view mirror.  You let out a sigh of relief.  Something in
    the mirror catches your eye, and you see that one of the upstairs windows of the
    house has a light shining in it.


    You Survived... But at what cost?


    Search for a different outcome?


    1) Yes, I can do better.


    2) No, I''ll quit while I''m ahead.'
