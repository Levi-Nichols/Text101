  storyText: 'Searching the night stand, you find what seems to be a diary.  It''s
    bound in some strange leather that is tattered and falling apart. You feel this
    is a perfect item to bring as proof, and you leave the house, returning to your
    friends.  Later, while alone in your room, you start to read the diary.  The words
    inside talk of horrible acts and strange entities, but you feel compelled to keep
    reading.  Page after page, your are drawn into the thoughts, feelings, and life
    of the previous owner.  After you read the last page, you close the diary, setting
    it to the side.  You stand up with a determined look on your face.  You understand
    now what must be done.


    You Survived... But at what cost?


    Search for a different outcome?


    1) Yes, I can do better.


    2) No, I''ll quit while I''m ahead.'
