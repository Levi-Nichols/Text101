  storyText: 'Searching the night stand, you find what seems to be a diary.  It''s
    bound in some strange leather that is tattered, and feeling this is a perfect
    thing to bring as proof you leave the house and return to your friends.  Later,
    while alone in your room, you start to read the diary.  The words inside talk
    of horrible acts and beings, but you can''t stop reading.  Page after page you,
    you are drawn into the thoughts, feelings, and life of the writer.  After you
    read the last page, you close the diary, setting it to the side, and stand up
    with a determined look on your face.  You now know what you must do.


    You Survived... But at what cost?


    Search for a different outcome?


    1) Yes, I can do better.


    2) No, I''ll quit while I''m ahead.'
