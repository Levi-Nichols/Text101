  storyText: 'You take the knife and sliding it in your belt, run back up the stairs.  You
    head out of the house but stop suddenly.  You don''t see your friends, the car,
    or even the street.  You only see a vast swampy landscape stretching in all directions.  In
    the distance, miles away, you see a dark, massive pyramid like structure.  Completely
    calm, and for some reason feeling a strong pull toward the monolith, you step
    off the porch onto the soft, wet ground and start to walk toward the structure...


    You Survived... But at what cost?

    1) Yes, I can do better.


    2) No, I''ll quit while I''m ahead.'
