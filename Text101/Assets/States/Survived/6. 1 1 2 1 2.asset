  storyText: 'You take the knife, and sliding it into your belt, run back up the stairs.  You
    head out of the house, but stop suddenly.  You don''t see your friends, the car,
    or even the street.  You only see a vast, swampy landscape stretching in all directions.  In
    the distance, miles away, you see a dark, massive pyramid like structure.  Unnaturally
    calm, you feel a strong pull toward the monolith.  You step off the porch onto
    the soft, wet ground and start to walk towards the structure...


    You Survived... But at what cost?


    Search for a different outcome?


    1) Yes, I can do better.


    2) No, I''ll quit while I''m ahead.'
