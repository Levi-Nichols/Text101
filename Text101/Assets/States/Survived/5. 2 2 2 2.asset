  storyText: 'You reach down picking up the pocket watch, staying as far away from
    the pile of bones as possible.  The watch is unnaturally cold to the touch, and
    has strange hieroglyphic like symbols engraved on it.  Opening it you see a cracked
    watch face, with the time stopped at three o''clock.  There is a picture as well
    of a family of four, the parents and two children, but there faces have been scratched
    out of the photo.  You leave, and drive home, but your dreams are haunted by faceless
    people, and you always feel like someone is watching you.


    You Survived... But at what cost?
