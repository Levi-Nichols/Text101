  storyText: 'You reach down picking up the pocket watch, staying as far away from
    the pile of bones as possible.  The watch is unnaturally cold to the touch, and
    has strange hieroglyphic-like symbols engraved on it.  Opening it you see a cracked
    watch face, with the hands stopped on three o''clock.  There is a picture inside
    of a family of four; a husband and wife and two children. There faces have been
    scratched out.  You return to your friends, and drive home, but your dreams start
    to become haunted by faceless beings...


    You Survived... But at what cost?


    Search for a different outcome?


    1) Yes, I can do better.


    2) No, I''ll quit while I''m ahead.'
