  storyText: "As the trapdoor descends, a ladder unfolds leading up to the attic.
    \ You ascend the ladder and pan your flashlight around the attic, seeing dusty
    furniture covered in moth eaten cloth.  Suddenly you pan over a dead body swinging
    from a noose, and you let out a scream.  You...\r\n\r\n1) Turn to head back down
    the ladder.\r\n\r\n2) Take some deep breaths and examine the body."
