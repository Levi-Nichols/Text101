  storyText: "Looking again, you don't see the body anymore, instead you see a pile
    of bones and old clothes on the floor beneath a tattered rope hanging from the
    rafters.  A golden glint draws your eye to a pocket watch a short distance from
    the skeletal remains.  Perhaps you could bring...\r\n\r\n1) The skull of the deceased
    back.  How much more metal can you get.  Your friends would never question how
    bad ass you are.\r\n\r\n2) The pocket watch back.  It could be valuable, and would
    get your friends off your back."
