  storyText: "Looking again, you don't see the body anymore, instead you see a pile
    of bones and tattered clothes on the floor beneath a fraying rope hanging from
    a rafter.  A golden glint draws your eye to a pocket watch a short distance from
    the skeletal remains.  Perhaps you could bring...\r\n\r\n1) The skull of the deceased
    back.  Can't get much more metal than that!  Your friends would never question
    how bad ass you are again.\r\n\r\n2) The pocket watch back.  It could be valuable,
    and would get your friends off your back."
