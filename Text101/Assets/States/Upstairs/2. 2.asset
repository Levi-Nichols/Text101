  storyText: "It's almost pitch black at the top of the stairs, the outside street
    lights unable to reach this part of the house.  You turn your phone's flashlight
    on, and look around.  Down the hallway you see two doorways, and a trapdoor partially
    hanging open from the ceiling. You decide to...\r\n\r\n1) Explore the rooms off
    the hall.\r\n\r\n2) Go to the end of the hall and pull the attic trapdoor down
    the rest of the way."
