  storyText: "Opening the wardrobe you see some \ntattered clothing hanging inside.
    \ Just beyond them, you see a sliver of light showing through, and moving the
    clothing aside you can hardly believe your eyes.  Inside is an alien landscape,
    with large dunes of red sand, and a sky of deep purple.  A dark red sun burns
    above you.  You turn to leave but find that behind you now is group of hooded
    figures in white robes.  The wardrobe and doorway is nowhere to be seen.  The
    hooded figures approach you with hands outstretched toward you and you scream
    before it is muffled there probing graps...\n\nYou've Perished\n\nTry again for
    a better outcome?\n\n1) Yes, I can overcome this!\n\n2) No, I resign to my fate"
