  storyText: "Opening the wardrobe you see some \ntattered coats hanging.  Just beyond
    them, you see a sliver of light showing through, and moving the coats aside you
    can hardly believe your eyes.  Inside is an alien landscape of large dunes of
    red sand, the sky is a deep purple, in which a dark red sun hangs.  You turn to
    leave but find that behind you now is group of hooded figures, no door, wardrobe
    or house in sight.  The hooded figures approach you with hands outstretched toward
    you and you scream before it is muffled below numerous searching hands...\n\nYou've
    Perished\n\nTry again for a better outcome?\n\n1) Yes, I can overcome this!\n2)
    No, I resign to my fate"
