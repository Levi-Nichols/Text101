  storyText: 'You pick up the decrepit skull, it''s eye sockets looking back at you
    with an empty black stare.  You smirk to yourself and turn to leave, but suddenly
    the trapdoor slams shut!  Your heart is racing, and you frantically pan your flashlight
    around the attic.  The stops on a black smokey figure floating just a few feet
    away.  You hear a piercing howl as the form rushes at you, and your world goes
    black.


    You''ve Perished
