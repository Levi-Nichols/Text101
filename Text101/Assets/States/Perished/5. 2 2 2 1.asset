    with empty black holes.  You smirk to yourself and turn to leave, but suddenly
    the trapdoor slams shut.  Your heart begins to pound in your chest, and you frantically
    pan your flashlight around the attic.  You stop on a black smokey figure floating
    just a few feet away.  Your ears are accosted by a piercing howl as the form rushes
    at you, and your world goes black.
