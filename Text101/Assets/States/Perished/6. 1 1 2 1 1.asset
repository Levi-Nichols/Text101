  storyText: 'The bowl is ice cold in your hands.  You quickly head back up the stairs
    and to the car where you friends are waiting.  Climbing into the car, you show
    them the bowl and tell them what you encountered in the mansion.  One of your
    friends suddenly exclaims, "Woah! there''s something in the bowl!"  Looking down
    you see the bowl has begun to rapidly fill with a black liquid.  You try to open
    the car door to throw the bowl out, but neither you nor your friends can get out.  The
    bowl is overflowing and starting to fill the car.  In moments the black liquid
    has filled the car, drowning you.  Your vision goes black...
