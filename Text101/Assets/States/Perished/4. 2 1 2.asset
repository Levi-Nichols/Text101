  storyText: 'The room has two small beds, destroyed by time, and a chest open to
    the left of them.  Inside the chest you see toys, and a particularly creepy doll
    catches your eye. Thinking this would would be the perfect, creepy proof to show
    to your friends.  You reach for it when suddenly the dolls head swivels and locks
    eyes with you, it''s mouth opening to reveal razor sharp teeth.  It lunges straight
    at your neck, and your vision goes black.


    You''ve Perished
