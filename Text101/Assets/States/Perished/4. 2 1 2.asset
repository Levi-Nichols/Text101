  storyText: 'The room has two small beds, destroyed by time, and a chest open to
    the left of them.  Inside the chest you see some old toys, and a particularly
    creepy doll catches your eye. Thinking this would would be the perfect, creepy
    proof to show to your friends.  You reach for it, when its head suddenly swivels
    and locks eyes with you, it''s mouth opening to reveal razor sharp teeth.  It
    lunges straight at your neck, and your vision goes black.


    You''ve Perished
