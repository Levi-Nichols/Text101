  storyText: 'You go to examine the strange engravings on the wall, and feel compelled
    to trace them with your fingers.  As you do, the engravings start to glow.  You''re
    mesmerized, and lose yourself in their weird intricacies.  You start to become
    incredibly cold.  Suddenly you''re walking up the stairs to the kitchen again,
    but you''re not controlling your movements.  You walk out of the house and to
    your friends car, and in a voice that''s yours but not you, you hear yourself
    say, "I couldn''t find anything in there, let''s get out of here.  You feel a
    sense of dread as whatever is controlling you gets behind the wheel of the car,
    a small smile playing at your lips...


    You''ve Perished
