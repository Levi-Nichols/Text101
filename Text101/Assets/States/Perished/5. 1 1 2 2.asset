  storyText: 'You go to examine the strange engravings on the wall, and feel compelled
    to trace them with your fingers.  As you do, the engravings start to glow.  You''re
    mesmerized, and lose yourself in them.  You become incredibly cold.  Suddenly
    you''re walking up the stairs to the kitchen again, but you''re not controlling
    your movements.  You walk out of the house and to your friends car, and in a voice
    that''s yours but not you, you hear yourself say, "I couldn''t find anything in
    there, let''s get out of here.  Hey, can I drive?"  You feel a sense of dread
    as whatever is controlling you gets behind the wheel of the car and starts to
    drive off...


    You''ve Perished


    Try again for a better outcome?


    1) Yes, I can overcome this!
